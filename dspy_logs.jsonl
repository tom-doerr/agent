Address untracked dspy_logs.jsonl (either add to .gitignore or version control)\n2. Consider adding error handling for model configuration failures\n3. Refine test assertions in simpledspy_main.py for predictable validation\n4. Explore output formatting improvements for better readability\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or propose implementation for any of the next steps?"}], "description": null, "timestamp": 1749394159.297238}

Address untracked dspy_logs.jsonl (either add to .gitignore or version control)\n2. Consider adding error handling for model configuration failures\n3.

Address untracked dspy_logs.jsonl (either add to .gitignore or version control)\n2. Consider adding error handling for model configuration failures\n3.

Address untracked dspy_logs.jsonl (either add to .gitignore or version control)\n2. Consider adding error handling for model configuration failures\n3. Refine test assertions in simpledspy_main.py for predictable validation\n4. Explore output formatting improvements for better readability\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or propose implementation for any of the next steps?\nDone: True\nUser: please do a few more iterations. show me the report after each iteration and look for new and additional information between each iteration\nAgent action: run_command\nCommand: git status && git log --oneline -n 5 && git diff -- agent_simpledspy.py simpledspy_main.py\nProcess started with PID: 3543422\nCommand output:\nOn branch main\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\tdspy_logs.jsonl\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n7ec703d .\n7034445 .\n01bbb09 .\na8bb17d .\n91c0526 .\nProcess finished with return code: 0\nDone: True, False\nUnknown option: True, False\nAgent action: reply_to_user\nDone: True\nUser: \nAgent action: reply_to_user\n"}, {"name": "options", "value": ["True", "False"]}], "outputs": [{"name": "self.context +", "value": "False"}], "description": "Is the agent done for now or does it need to continue working to finish open tasks?

The function is counting 1795 lines when it should return 0 for such files. Here's the plan to fix this:\n\n1. **Modify the file detection logic** in `count_lines_of_code()` to:\n```python\ndef count_lines_of_code(file_path):\n    try:\n        # Attempt to read as text while checking for binary patterns\n        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:\n            chunk = f.read(1024)\n            if b'\\x00' in chunk:  # Null byte detection\n                return 0\n    except Exception:\n        return 0\n\n    # Proceed with normal line counting if not binary\n    # ... [existing line counting logic]\n```\n\n2. **Update the test case** in `tests/test_binary_files.py` to verify mixed content handling:\n```python\ndef test_mixed_content_files(tmp_path):\n    # Create test file with text + binary content\n    mixed_file = tmp_path / \"mixed.dat\"\n    mixed_file.write_bytes(b\"Valid text\\x00Binary content\\xFF\\xFE\")\n    \n    assert count_lines_of_code(mixed_file) == 0\n```\n\n3. **Verify the fix** by running:\n```bash\ncd /home/tom/git/project_monitor && pytest tests/test_binary_files.py -x -v\n```\n\nWould you like me to implement these changes directly? I can:\n1. Locate the `count_lines_of_code` implementation\n2. Apply the null-byte detection patch\n3. Update the test case\n4.

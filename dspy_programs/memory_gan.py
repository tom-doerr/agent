"""
DSPy program to implement a 'Memory GAN' like system.

- QuestionGenerator: Creates challenging questions from source_text.
- MemoryModule: Answers questions based on 'internalized' knowledge (tries to mimic memory).
- ReferenceModule: Answers questions with full access to source_text (oracle).

SIMBA will optimize these jointly to make the QuestionGenerator good at stumping the MemoryModule
while ensuring questions are valid (answerable by ReferenceModule).

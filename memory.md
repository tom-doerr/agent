# Task Management Policies

## Exercise & Health
- **HIF (High Intensity Fitness)**: Preferred term for treadmill exercise
- **Shower timing**: Ideal after HIF during daytime; avoid late showers due to noise
- **Exercise environment**: Treadmill is quiet enough for indoor use; no rails needed
- **Nootropics routine**: Standard mix includes 1600mg potassium, 400mg l-theanine, 100mg caffeine, 1g magnesium threonate

## System & Storage
- **Storage thresholds**: Critical when <5GB free; concerning when <100GB free
- **Memory management**: <4GB free RAM is acceptable
- **Service monitoring**: Twitter posting service requires 28+ posts buffer (14+ hours)

## Task Organization
- **Schedule format**: Use emojis for visual recognition; avoid seconds in timestamps
- **Priority levels**: Critical (revenue/health/workflow), High, Deferred
- **Backlog triage**: Review when energy allows; pre-triage important items
- **AI task tracking**: Use â˜… prefix for AI answers; remove done tasks from artifact

## Communication & Social
- **Messenger routine**: Reply to all services in evening
- **Social activity**: Important for wellbeing; contact friends regularly

## Development Practices
- **Application completion**: Simple apps with immediate value get finished
- **Context management**: Include timewarrior history, recent files, system info
- **Privacy preference**: Prefer local models over remote services for sensitive data


## Health & Nootropics Insights
- **L-Theanine effects**: Increases alertness by modulating neurotransmitters; prevents adenosine buildup; may increase libido through stress reduction
- **L-Theanine + Lisdexamfetamine**: Complementary combination - theanine reduces stimulant side effects while maintaining focus
- **Evening theanine**: Adding l-theanine to evening nootropics water promotes better sleep and earlier bedtime

## Development & Tooling
- **Search-replace approach**: More efficient than complete rewrites for maintaining large artifacts; enables incremental optimization
- **Package management**: Poetry and UV both suitable for publishing; Poetry has broader ecosystem, UV offers faster performance
- **Package naming**: For-dec decision modules should be published as separate focused packages rather than monolithic bundles

## Data Management
- **Constraint versioning**: Use private git repositories or encrypted storage for sensitive constraint files; avoid public GitHub for personal data


## Application Development Insights
- **Completion likelihood**: Simple applications with immediate value are more likely to get finished; complex projects without clear short-term benefits tend to remain incomplete

## Context Enhancement
- **Timewarrior integration**: Including timewarrior history in NLCO context provides valuable temporal patterns and work rhythm insights
- **Evening routine optimization**: Adding l-theanine to evening nootropics water consistently promotes better sleep quality and earlier bedtime

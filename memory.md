# Task Management Policies

## Exercise & Health
- **HIF (High Intensity Fitness)**: Preferred term for treadmill exercise
- **Shower timing**: Ideal after HIF during daytime; avoid late showers due to noise
- **Exercise environment**: Treadmill is quiet enough for indoor use; no rails needed
- **Nootropics routine**: Standard mix includes 1600mg potassium, 400mg l-theanine, 100mg caffeine, 1g magnesium threonate

## System & Storage
- **Storage thresholds**: Critical when <5GB free; concerning when <100GB free
- **Memory management**: <4GB free RAM is acceptable
- **Service monitoring**: Twitter posting service requires 28+ posts buffer (14+ hours); levels below this threshold represent urgent situations requiring immediate attention to maintain revenue

## Task Organization
- **Schedule format**: Use emojis for visual recognition; avoid seconds in timestamps
- **Priority levels**: Critical (revenue/health/workflow), High, Deferred
- **Backlog triage**: Review when energy allows; pre-triage important items
- **AI task tracking**: Use ★ prefix for AI answers; immediately move answered tasks from pending to done section in artifact
- **Daily routine structure**: Include HIF exercise, nootropics preparation, and backlog triage as core daily components

## Communication & Social
- **Messenger routine**: Reply to all services in evening
- **Social activity**: Important for wellbeing; contact friends regularly

## Development Practices
- **Application completion**: Simple apps with immediate value get finished
- **Context management**: Include timewarrior history, recent files, system info
- **Privacy preference**: Prefer local models over remote services for sensitive data


## Health & Nootropics Insights
- **L-Theanine effects**: Increases alertness by modulating neurotransmitters; prevents adenosine buildup by promoting relaxation and increasing alpha brain waves; may increase libido through stress reduction and anxiety reduction
- **L-Theanine + Lisdexamfetamine**: Complementary combination - theanine reduces stimulant side effects while maintaining focus; smooths jitteriness for improved comfort
- **Evening theanine routine**: Consistently adding l-theanine to evening nootropics water promotes better sleep quality, earlier bedtime, and improved sleep-wake cycle regulation; user has repeatedly emphasized this as a valuable practice
- **L-Theanine mechanisms**: Promotes alpha brain waves for relaxed alertness; reduces stress-induced adenosine production; enhances mental clarity without sedation

## Development & Tooling
- **Search-replace approach**: More efficient than complete rewrites for maintaining large artifacts; enables incremental optimization
- **Package management**: Poetry and UV both suitable for publishing; Poetry has broader ecosystem, UV offers faster performance
- **Package naming**: For-dec decision modules should be published as separate focused packages rather than monolithic bundles

## Data Management
- **Constraint versioning**: Use private git repositories or encrypted storage for sensitive constraint files; avoid public GitHub for personal data


## Application Development Insights
- **Completion likelihood**: Simple applications with immediate value are more likely to get finished; complex projects without clear short-term benefits tend to remain incomplete

## Context Enhancement
- **Timewarrior integration**: Including timewarrior history in NLCO context provides valuable temporal patterns and work rhythm insights; enables better planning and productivity tracking
- **Evening routine optimization**: Adding l-theanine to evening nootropics water consistently promotes better sleep quality and earlier bedtime





## Leveling Laser Elevation
- **Ceiling height options**: Use tripod with extension pole, mount on tall stable object (ladder/shelf), attach to ceiling fixture with magnetic base/adhesive, use suction cup mount on high smooth surfaces, or construct custom elevation setup with poles leaned against wall
- **Additional methods**: Tripod with extension pole or telescopic stand; mounting on tall stable objects like ladder or shelf; attachment to ceiling fixtures using magnetic base, adhesive pads, or clamps; suction cup mount on smooth high surfaces like windows near ceiling; custom elevation setup using poles or rods leaned against wall
- **Safety considerations**: Always check load capacity and avoid placing near edges to prevent damage or injury; ensure stability on uneven surfaces; test adhesion first for suction cup mounts


## Financial & Legal
- **Tax obligations for Kleinunternehmer**: No income tax if earnings below €22,000 annually for VAT; must submit advance VAT returns (Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung) quarterly; check Elster for deadlines; prioritize completing and submitting tax declarations to avoid penalties

## Safety & Hardware
- **Electric shock safety**: Charger shocks likely due to grounding issues or static buildup; avoid using problematic chargers; switch to certified, grounded chargers; consult electrician if persistent to prevent safety risks

## Development Practices
- **Ambient AI agent delegation**: Use tools like LangChain or AutoGPT for task automation; define clear, repetitive tasks (data fetching, social media monitoring); use DSPy modules to create agents with memory; implement trials with simple tasks like email sorting or calendar reminders; use markdown files for persistent memory
- **System health monitoring**: Add health checks to NLCO using shell tools to alert on service failures (e.g., Twitter posting script); monitor disk space and system services regularly


## Task Management Insights
- **Taskwarrior integration**: Adding taskwarrior support to NLCO enables automated task tracking and management; provides better context for planning and productivity analysis; supports time tracking and task status monitoring for improved workflow efficiency

## AI Task Management & Delegation
- **Ambient AI agent implementation**: Use frameworks like LangChain or AutoGPT for automation; start with repetitive tasks (data fetching, social media monitoring); implement DSPy modules with markdown-based memory for persistence; trial with simple actions (calendar reminders) to validate reliability; integrate into NLCO for task management and context awareness; use local LLMs for privacy; scale gradually by adding complex tasks once system proves stable
- **Tax compliance for Kleinunternehmer**: Quarterly advance VAT returns (Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung) via Elster are mandatory regardless of income level; prioritize gathering income documents, recording expenses, updating Elster access keys for security, and submitting returns even with unclear income (estimate based on available data); schedule tax tasks when feasible to avoid penalties

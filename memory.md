# Task Management Policies

## Exercise & Health
- **HIF (High Intensity Fitness)**: Preferred term for treadmill exercise
- **Shower timing**: Ideal after HIF during daytime; avoid late showers due to noise
- **Exercise environment**: Treadmill is quiet enough for indoor use; no rails needed
- **Nootropics routine**: Standard mix includes 1600mg potassium, 400mg l-theanine, 100mg caffeine, 1g magnesium threonate

## System & Storage
- **Storage thresholds**: Critical when <100GB free; emergency when <5GB free; immediate action required when approaching critical thresholds to prevent service failures
- **Memory management**: <4GB free RAM is acceptable
- **Service monitoring**: Twitter posting service requires 28+ posts buffer (14+ hours) as minimum threshold; optimal buffer is 50-100 posts (25-50 hours) as preferred target to prevent late-night post creation sessions and support consistent sleep schedule; maintain buffer above 50 posts whenever possible to avoid disruption; levels below 28 posts represent urgent situations requiring immediate attention to maintain revenue; buffer below 10 posts represents critical emergency requiring immediate post creation; zero posts remaining represents immediate revenue loss requiring emergency response; repeated experience confirms that allowing buffer to reach zero causes revenue loss, disrupts sleep patterns, and creates workflow stress; maintaining adequate buffer levels is critical for sustainable revenue and sleep consistency

## Task Organization
- **Schedule format**: Use emojis for visual recognition; avoid seconds in timestamps
- **Priority levels**: Critical (revenue/health/workflow), High, Deferred
- **Backlog triage**: Review when energy allows; pre-triage important items
- **AI task tracking**: Use ★ prefix for AI answers; immediately move answered tasks from pending to done section in artifact
- **Daily routine structure**: Include HIF exercise, nootropics preparation, and backlog triage as core daily components

## Communication & Social
- **Messenger routine**: Reply to all services in evening
- **Social activity**: Important for wellbeing; contact friends regularly

## Development Practices
- **Application completion**: Simple apps with immediate value get finished
- **Context management**: Include timewarrior history, recent files, system info
- **Privacy preference**: Prefer local models over remote services for sensitive data


## Health & Nootropics Insights
- **L-Theanine effects**: Increases alertness by modulating neurotransmitters; prevents adenosine buildup by promoting relaxation and increasing alpha brain waves; may increase libido through stress reduction and anxiety reduction
- **L-Theanine + Lisdexamfetamine**: Complementary combination - theanine reduces stimulant side effects while maintaining focus; smooths jitteriness for improved comfort
- **Evening theanine routine**: Consistently adding l-theanine to evening nootropics water promotes better sleep quality, earlier bedtime, and improved sleep-wake cycle regulation; user has repeatedly emphasized this as a valuable practice and should be maintained as part of the evening routine; recent constraints reinforce this as an important habit for sleep optimization

## Development & Tooling
- **Search-replace approach**: More efficient than complete rewrites for maintaining large artifacts; enables incremental optimization
- **Package management**: Poetry and UV both suitable for publishing; Poetry has broader ecosystem, UV offers faster performance
- **Package naming**: For-dec decision modules should be published as separate focused packages rather than monolithic bundles

## Data Management
- **Constraint versioning**: Use private git repositories or encrypted storage for sensitive constraint files; avoid public GitHub for personal data


## Application Development Insights
- **Completion likelihood**: Simple applications with immediate value are more likely to get finished; complex projects without clear short-term benefits tend to remain incomplete

## Context Enhancement
- **Timewarrior integration**: Including timewarrior history in NLCO context provides valuable temporal patterns and work rhythm insights; enables better planning and productivity tracking
- **Evening routine optimization**: Adding l-theanine to evening nootropics water consistently promotes better sleep quality and earlier bedtime





## Leveling Laser Elevation
- **Ceiling height options**: Tripod with extension pole; mount on tall stable objects (ladder/shelf); attach to ceiling fixtures with magnetic base/adhesive/clamps; suction cup mount on smooth high surfaces; custom elevation setup with poles leaned against wall
- **Safety considerations**: Always check load capacity and avoid placing near edges to prevent damage or injury; ensure stability on uneven surfaces; test adhesion first for suction cup mounts


## Financial & Legal
- **Tax obligations for Kleinunternehmer**: No income tax if earnings below €22,000 annually for VAT; must submit advance VAT returns (Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung) quarterly; check Elster for deadlines; prioritize completing and submitting tax declarations to avoid penalties

## Safety & Hardware
- **Electric shock safety**: Charger shocks likely due to grounding issues or static buildup; avoid using problematic chargers; switch to certified, grounded chargers; consult electrician if persistent to prevent safety risks

## Development Practices
- **Ambient AI agent delegation**: Use tools like LangChain or AutoGPT for task automation; define clear, repetitive tasks (data fetching, social media monitoring); use DSPy modules to create agents with memory; implement trials with simple tasks like email sorting or calendar reminders; use markdown files for persistent memory
- **System health monitoring**: Add health checks to NLCO using shell tools to alert on service failures (e.g., Twitter posting script); monitor disk space and system services regularly


## Task Management Insights
- **Taskwarrior integration**: Adding taskwarrior support to NLCO enables automated task tracking and management; provides better context for planning and productivity analysis; supports time tracking and task status monitoring for improved workflow efficiency

## AI Task Management & Delegation
- **Ambient AI agent implementation**: Use frameworks like LangChain or AutoGPT for automation; start with repetitive tasks (data fetching, social media monitoring); implement DSPy modules with markdown-based memory for persistence; trial with simple actions (calendar reminders) to validate reliability; integrate into NLCO for task management and context awareness; use local LLMs for privacy; scale gradually by adding complex tasks once system proves stable
- **Tax compliance for Kleinunternehmer**: Quarterly advance VAT returns (Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung) via Elster are mandatory regardless of income level; prioritize gathering income documents, recording expenses, updating Elster access keys for security, and submitting returns even with unclear income (estimate based on available data); schedule tax tasks when feasible to avoid penalties


## Development & Integration
- **Twitter API integration**: Use Twitter API v2 to stream DMs and mentions; implement Python scripts with libraries like tweepy for automated message handling; consider webhooks for real-time updates or polling for simplicity; enables automated engagement and message prioritization
- **Web frontend options**: Flask/FastAPI backend with React/Vue for scalability; Streamlit for rapid Python-based prototyping; simple HTML/CSS/JS setup for basic interfaces; choose based on familiarity, real-time feature needs, and maintenance effort








## Learning & Development
- **Grammar learning with AI**: Use AI chat assistants to systematically learn grammar rules through interactive practice and explanations; enables personalized learning at own pace
- **Nootropic combinations**: Test modafinil with lisdexamfetamine to understand synergistic effects and potential benefits for focus and wakefulness; approach cautiously with controlled experimentation


## AI Implementation & Safety Insights

**Nootropic Recommender Implementation**: Use DSPy modules with local reasoning LLMs to suggest nootropics based on user input; start with simple rule-based approaches and iterate with privacy-focused models for sensitive health data

**Grammar Learning with AI**: Leverage AI chat assistants for systematic grammar rule learning through interactive practice, explanations, and corrections; enables personalized learning at own pace

**Modafinil + Lisdexamfetamine Safety**: Both are stimulants; combination may increase risks of anxiety, insomnia, or cardiovascular issues; start with low doses (100mg modafinil + 20mg LDX), monitor effects closely, and consult healthcare professional; test on low-stakes days only

**Ambient AI Agent Delegation**: Use DSPy agents for automating routine tasks (file management, email sorting, social media posting); implement tools for common actions with value function prioritization; start with simple tasks and scale gradually

**Persistent Agent Memory**: Use markdown files to store agent state, history, and context; implement shell tools for read/write operations; add memory modules that append interactions and retrieve relevant context

**Neovim Config Management**: Ensure agents detect neovim config changes and reload automatically; use file watchers or hooks to monitor config files and trigger reloads; test with incremental edits to avoid disruptions


## AI Task Management
- **AI answer formatting**: Use ★ prefix to clearly mark AI-generated answers in artifact; immediately move answered tasks from pending to done section to maintain clean task tracking
- **Answer integration**: AI responses should provide actionable implementation guidance for technical tasks and safety considerations for health-related experiments
- **Task completion flow**: Once AI provides satisfactory answer and user confirms completion, remove task from pending list to prevent duplication


## Twitter Integration & Development
- **Twitter messages integration**: Use Twitter API v2 for fetching/sending messages with privacy and rate limit considerations; implement Python scripts with libraries like tweepy; consider webhooks for real-time updates or polling for simplicity; enables automated engagement and message prioritization
- **Web frontend authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 or token-based authentication for NLCO web interfaces; use libraries like Auth0 or Flask-Login for streamlined setup; ensure secure storage of credentials and proper access controls
- **DSPy module packaging**: Create focused, single-purpose packages for decision modules (e.g., "dspy-task-line" for per-line task processing); supports modularity and ease of use in larger systems
